# The default shallowness if not using "-" or "+" update syntax (see below).
# supported values: "yes", "no" (anything not "yes" is considered "no").
# If "yes", it generally ends up using --depth=... with fetch or pull.
config_git_shallow=yes

# Depth when using shallow. 2 allows incremental fetch with shallow even if the
# last commit at the remote was replaced, e.g. with force push.
config_git_shallow_depth=2

# Note on repo shallowness:
# Even if the config ends up shallow, --depth=... will not be used if the repo
# at the dir is not shallow. That is, it will not change a normal repo into
# shallow one. The other way (shallow repo, config not shallow) will be
# respected and --depth=... will _not_ be used, however, this doesn't magically
# make the repo "full", and git will fetch as many commits as it needs - if it
# can fetch incrementally from a local commit then that's all it will fetch,
# and if not then the entire history - but the repo remains in "shallow mode".
# To manually change shallowness of a repo:
#   To make a repo shallow: git fetch --depth=1 <remote>
#   To unshallow a repo:    git fetch --unshallow <remote>
# If you don't care about the repo dir (i.e. it doesn't have local commits you
# want to keep etc), the easiest way to change shallowness is deleting its
# source dir and update it from scratch - which will respect the shallow config.

# per-project config, e.g. for project foo (missing config is empty value):
#   config_foo_source       source dir
#   config_foo_update       update value (see below). except none and hook:
#     config_foo_git             git repo URL
#     config_foo_release_prefix  see update "release" below
#     config_foo_update_post     hook for internal use
#   config_foo_opts_config  configure options before CLI options (if used)
#   config_foo_opts_build   build options before CLI options (if used)

# CLI arguments can modify $config_foo_update values.
# $config_foo_update controls the update, usually [clone+] fetch + checkout:
#   "head"    latest remote origin/HEAD
#   "release" highest remote release tag with prefix $config_foo_release_prefix
#   "rebase"  "git pull -r" (needs to already be at a tracked branch)
#   "^BAR"    latest state of the remote [fuzzy] tag/branch/ref/PR BAR
#   "@BAZ"    "git fetch && git checkout BAZ"
#   "!QUX"    doesn't do anything other than executing hook (see below) QUX
#   "none"    skip update of this project completely.
# ^BAR is smart-ish: BAR may be a full or a tag/branch(head) ref suffix, or PR,
#   e.g. my-tag, tags/my-tag, and refs/tags/my-tag likely resolve the same ref,
#   though a fuller ref reduces ambiguities. #42 or PR42 or 42 also works.
# Shallow: except "none" and "!QUX", the value can be prefixed with '-' for
#   shallow or with '+' to not use shallow - overriding $config_git_shallow.
#   E.g. "-head" or "-^v0.25" are shallow, and "+head" or "+^v0.25" are not.
#   However, it still will not use shallow if an existing repo isn't shallow.

# Note on repo setup:
# Except "none" and "!QUX", ./update sets and uses $config_main-build-remote so
# that it doesn't modify "origin" while still able to fetch from the configured
# URL. This means that "git fetch --all" will also fetch from our remote, and
# can make some listings slightly more noisy (git log, gitk, etc).
# You can prevent generic fetches from our remote, while still allowing the
# specific fetches which ./update typically does, by e.g.:
#   git remote set-branches mpv-build-remote 'non-existing-branch-*'

# Normally this isn't required, but on systems with non-default prefix which

# or on linux if /usr/local has ffmpeg-dev installed for instance.
# Best is ensuring a package we build is not also installed at such prefix.
